# Weather-5Day-Outlook

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create an easy 5-day calendar outlook for a city which you might be travelling to. This project was supposed to showcase our ability to pull API calls and use the data in a meaningful way which we can use in future applications. This particular problem will help you determine if you need to bring an umbrella or avoid a hurricane, or any manner of weather you may encounter on a business trip or family vacation.

I learned about API calls and how to integrate the data I recieve by itterating through arrays to pull the corresponding data that I need to make my program/application
